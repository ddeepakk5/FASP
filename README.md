## Face Detection System with Real-Time Processing and Redis Integration

## Description

This project is a real-time face detection system developed using Python. It leverages advanced machine learning models for accurate face detection and integrates with a database to enhance functionality. The system features a user-friendly UI built with **Streamlit** and incorporates **Redis** for efficient data management and caching. The **OpenCV** library powers real-time object detection, ensuring high performance and accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV for capturing and processing real-time video streams.
- **Buffalo Models**: Employs **Buffalo_L** and **Buffalo_Sc** from **InsightFace** for precise face detection and recognition.
- **User Interface**: A simple and interactive UI designed with **Streamlit**.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes **Redis** for storing and managing face detection data.
- **Scalable**: Built with modular components to allow easy updates and scaling.
